# Protester's Bible
Project for Make School Fall Intensive 1.1

## Project Description
The Protester's Bible is a website to help protestors prepare properly and stay safe. There is much information online on these topics, but much of the info spread can either be hard to understand, or even be wrong, and possibly lead to more harm in the event of civil unrest. 

The goal was to create a simple, easy on the eyes website with information that protesters could utilize.

## Coding
All of the site was coded in HTML and CSS with Animate on Scroll Javascript outsourced from https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

I started with a base layout of each page, adding in styles for each one.
The Prepare and Aid pages follow the same style layout.
