# Protester's Bible
Project for Make School Fall Intensive 1.1

## Project Description
The Protester's Bible is a website to help protestors prepare properly and stay safe. There is much information online on these topics, but much of the info spread can either be hard to understand, or even be wrong, and possibly lead to more harm in the event of civil unrest. 

The goal was to create a simple, easy on the eyes website with information that protesters could utilize.

## Coding
All of the site was coded in HTML and CSS with Animate on Scroll Javascript outsourced from https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

Fonts were sourced from Google Fonts

Temporary logo is from https://logomaker.com

I started with a base layout of each page, adding in styles for each one.
Each section of a page was coded on part at a time starting from the top.
Almost every section of the site has at least one image and one section of text.
Each were styled using flexbox model sans Prepare/Aid pages which used grid display
