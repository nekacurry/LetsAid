# Protester's Bible
Project for Fall Intensive 1.1

## Project Description
The Protester's Bible is a website to help protestors prepare properly and stay safe. There is much information online on these topics, but much of the info spread can either be hard to understand, or even be wrong, and possibly lead to more harm in the event of civil unrest. 

The goal was to create a simple, easy on the eyes website with information that protesters could utilize.
